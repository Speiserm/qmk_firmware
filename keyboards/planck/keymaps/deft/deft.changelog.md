# The Deft Changelog

Deft Version 1.1

A modified Workman layout designed for efficiency in programming and transferability between ortholinear boards.

---

**Version 1.0**
- Initial release

**Version 1.1**
- Added Let's Split layout
- Removed numpad from the lower layer of the Planck layout, the numpad layout is obscure and I never use it anyway.

---

TODO:

Figure out if space/enter should be under homing keys or if it should be lower/raise
Figure out the positions of brackets, curly braces should probably be on the botton for Helix
Work out leader functionality

**Deft is currently supported on the following boards:**

Planck (12x4)

Let's Split (12x4 split)

**Coming soon to:**

Ergodox

Helidox

XD75

Collide39
